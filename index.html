  <p><strong>The British diet has undergone a transformation in the last half-century</strong>. Traditional staples such as eggs, potatoes and butter have gradually given way to more exotic or convenient foods such as aubergines, olive oil and stir-fry packs.</p>
  <p>Explore the changes across four decades and hundreds of food and drink categories in this interactive visualisation, featuring data from the <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs" title="Defra" target="_blank">Department for Agriculture, Farming and Rural Affairs</a> (Defra)</strong>. Defra has just released almost 30 years of food diaries filled out by British families between the 1970s and 2000 as <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/family_food_open_data" title="Family food open data" target="_blank">open data</a>. This is part of #OpenDefra, and 2016: Year of Great British Food.</p>
  <p>You can find out more about the history of the data and how some food categories have been described <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/family_food_open_data" title="Family food open data" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
